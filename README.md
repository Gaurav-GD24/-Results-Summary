## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
The ``HTML`` I provided utilizes the data attribute extensively
These data attributes provide a flexible way to extend the functionality of HTML elements beyond their standard attributes, making them quite powerful for web development. They can be accessed and manipulated via JavaScript for dynamic behavior or styled using CSS for custom styling based on the provided data.
